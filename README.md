# Loss Graph
A simple tool written on python which allows to evaluate the training dynamics of a neural network. The input data is represented by the the log which the [NetapixTrain app](https://github.com/touchlane/Netapix) produces during the neural network training process. One can copy the output from the terminal, insert it into a text file and get a visualisation of the training progress when running the script.
