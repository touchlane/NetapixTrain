NetapixTrain is a neural network framework written on pure C. For now it supports CPU mode only. The purpose of the project is investigation of  deep neural networks behavior and designing new and effective architectures of convolutional networks.

# Installation
```
make
```

# Usage

### Train brand new model
```
./example/bin/netapix train [NPX_PATH] [NPT_PATH]  
```
Folders `weights` and `weights/params` will be created at the `[NPX_PATH]`.   
- `weights` for trained weights `.npw` file.   
- `weights/params` for copied configuration `.npx` file.


### Continue training existing model
```
./example/bin/netapix train [NPX_PATH] [NPT_PATH] [NPW_PATH]  
```
Folders `weights` and `weights/params` will be created at the `[NPW_PATH]`.   
- `weights` for new trained weights `.npw` file.   
- `weights/params` for copied configuration `.npx` and `.npw` files that were used to continue training.


### Test the model
```
./example/bin/netapix run [NPI_PATH] [NPW_PATH] [OUTPUT_PATH]  
```
Output file `.npo` will be created under `[OUTPUT_PATH]` folder.  
`[OUTPUT_PATH]` is optional. Default value at executable filepath â€“ `./example/bin/output/`.

## Formats

Netapix works with custom formats. There are number of tools for conversion available [here](https://github.com/touchlane/NetapixTools)

### .npx
Special format to define network structure and learning policy. See example of simple convolutional network for MNIST dataset below:

```
[config]
batch=32
threads=4
channels=1
width=28
height=28
init=xavier
validation=10
backup=5000
learning=gradient
regularization=L2
accuracy=0.00001
eta=0.01
momentum=0
lambda=0
alpha=0.99
beta=1.01
gamma=1.01

[convolutional]
width=14
height=14
channels=100
stride=1
padding=0
activation=relu

[convolutional]
width=14
height=14
channels=10
stride=1
padding=0
activation=relu

[convolutional]
width=2
height=2
channels=10
stride=1
padding=0
activation=relu

[loss]
input=10
activation=msqe
```

### .npw

Particular format for binary files with weights. Every .npw file follows the same structure:
```
[number of layers][4 bytes]

[layer config] [4 bytes * 15]
[weights] [4 bytes * n]
[biases] [4 bytes * m]

[layer config] [4 bytes * 15]
[weights] [4 bytes * n_1]
[biases] [4 bytes * m_1]
.
.
.
[layer config] [4 bytes * 15]
[weights] [4 bytes * n_k]
[biases] [4 bytes * m_l]
```

### .npt

Distinct file format for train binary files of the NetapixTrain framework. It consists of two consequtive one-dimensional arrays with float32.

### .npi

Custom format for input binary files of the NetapixTrain framework. Contains two consequtive one-dimensional arrays with numbers of float32 format.

### .npo

Peculiar format for output binary files of the NetapixTrain framework. This format has one-dimensional array of 4-byte float inside.
